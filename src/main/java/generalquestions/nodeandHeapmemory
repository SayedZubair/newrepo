hashmap and arraylist are using arrays in backgorund thats why data retriaval is fast and arrays in heap memry creates and specifci
spot with a defined storage area such as an array with size 10 //a storage with that size will be allocated to array




now tree map and linked hashmap and linked list are using  node storage in background means once the map or list is creade
in the heap memory the date will be stored as nodes meaninnf every node will be located  scattered in differnent parts of heap memory
and one node has the addrss of its previous and next node ..thorefore if we give an index like give me the value of the index 5
in the map //it will not be able to give us the index value directly , it has start searching from index 0 to reach to that desired
index
